# wishlist-miniproject

# The idea for the project is to create a wishlist that communicates between a database, our own project and getting it hosted on a server.

# the technologies we are using are:
- The program is coded in Java (coded in IntelliJ)
- our database system is mySQL
- Thymeleaf template engine + spring boot to host our web application
- JDBC API
